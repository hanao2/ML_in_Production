# Creating a  Web Application for Extracting Text from Image.

In this Project we aim to develop a web application that receives user data (image for now) and outputs the text embodied in it. We use flask as the web application framework. Also, Microsoft Azure Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the model/API that we employ for the text extraction.
